Instead, it will learn to take a word in a song and guess the next one (eg. It will get the word \"Happy\" and try to guess \"Birthday\"). **The data will be able to 'label' itself since we will be giving it one word in a song, and make the student guess the next one.**\n",

        "2. Numericalize: Convert each word into a unique token (because the computer likes numbers). To continue the example, [\"happy\", \"birthday\", \"to\", \"you\", \",\", \"happy\", \"birthday\", \"to\", \"you\"] -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3] where 0 = \"happy\", 1 = \"birthday\", 2 = \"to\", 3 = \"you\", 4 = \",\". \n",
        "3. Dataloaders: Finally, we will make the data for a 'guess next word student'. The way this works is that we give the student \"Happy\" with \"birthday\" as the correct answer (label), then \"birthday\" with \"to\" as the label, then \"to\" with \"you\" as the label and so on. **Student is given the first words in a song and is told to guess the second one. Then the student is given the second and guesses the third. This pattern continues multiple times.**\n",
