        "\n",
        "##### The learning task: Using 'self-supervised learning' for teaching the student to learn songs without us having to specifically 'label' the song lyrics. Instead, it will learn to take a word in a song and guess the next one (eg. It will get the word \"Happy\" and try to guess \"Birthday\"). **The data will be able to 'label' itself since we will be giving it one word in a song, and make the student guess the next one.**\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Turn lyrics into something the computer can understand:\n",
        "1. Tokenize: Convert the song lyrics (string) into a list of words. As a simple example, \"happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you\" -> [\"happy\", \"birthday\", \"to\", \"you\", \",\", \"happy\", \"birthday\", \"to\", \"you\"]. \n",
        "2. Numericalize: Convert each word into a unique token (because the computer likes numbers). To continue the example, [\"happy\", \"birthday\", \"to\", \"you\", \",\", \"happy\", \"birthday\", \"to\", \"you\"] -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3] where 0 = \"happy\", 1 = \"birthday\", 2 = \"to\", 3 = \"you\", 4 = \",\". \n",
        "3. Dataloaders: Finally, we will make the data for a 'guess next word student'. The way this works is that we give the student \"Happy\" with \"birthday\" as the correct answer (label), then \"birthday\" with \"to\" as the label, then \"to\" with \"you\" as the label and so on. **Student is given the first words in a song and is told to guess the second one. Then the student is given the second and guesses the third. This pattern continues multiple times.**\n",

        "You can think of the dataloaders as the books we are giving the student to learn from. The books contain questions and answers (similar to a math textbook) so that the student can learn when it is right and wrong. Remember: in this case the 'questions' in the textbook are one word in a song and the 'answer' is the next word in the song. "

Start with the basic Python one and go from there). They are all free and only take a few hours to complete so they are a great way to get started. \n",

Learn about deep learning with fastai deep learning for coders free course. **Most of the information I learned which is in this notebook is from there.** They have a course website with some video lessons which can be found here: https://course.fast.ai/, as well as a free textbook in the form of python notebooks (like what we are using right now) which can be found here: https://github.com/fastai/fastbook. This is an amazing course to learn about deep learning and I would really recommend it. \n",
